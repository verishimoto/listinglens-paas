                                                             If the "--target" option is omitted, but a file name is provided on the command line, then that is used instead.
                                                             (defaults to "lib\main.dart")

    --build-number                                           An identifier used as an internal version number.
                                                             Each build must have a unique identifier to differentiate it from previous builds.
                                                             It is used to determine whether one build is more recent than another, with higher numbers indicating more recent build.
                                                             On Android it is used as "versionCode".
                                                             On Xcode builds it is used as "CFBundleVersion".
                                                             On Windows it is used as the build suffix for the product and file versions.
    --build-name=<x.y.z>                                     A "x.y.z" string used as the version number shown to users.
                                                             For each new version of your app, you will provide a version number to differentiate it from previous versions.
                                                             On Android it is used as "versionName".
                                                             On Xcode builds it is used as "CFBundleShortVersionString".
                                                             On Windows it is used as the major, minor, and patch parts of the product and file versions.

    --profile                                                Build a version of your app specialized for performance profiling.
    --release                                                Build a release version of your app (default mode).
-D, --dart-define=<foo=bar>                                  Additional key-value pairs that will be available as constants from the String.fromEnvironment, bool.fromEnvironment, and int.fromEnvironment constructors.
                                                             Multiple defines can be passed by repeating "--dart-define" multiple times.
    --dart-define-from-file=<use-define-config.json|.env>    The path of a .json or .env file containing key-value pairs that will be available as environment variables.
                                                             These can be accessed using the String.fromEnvironment, bool.fromEnvironment, and int.fromEnvironment constructors.
                                                             Multiple defines can be passed by repeating "--dart-define-from-file" multiple times.
                                                             Entries from "--dart-define" with identical keys take precedence over entries from these files.
    --[no-]native-null-assertions                            Enables additional runtime null checks in web applications to ensure the correct nullability of native (such as in dart:html) and external (such as with JS interop) types. This is enabled by default but only takes effect in sound mode. To report an issue with a null assertion failure in dart:html or the other dart web libraries, please file a bug at: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/labels/web-libraries
                                                             (defaults to on)

Flutter web options
    --base-href                                              Overrides the href attribute of the <base> tag in web/index.html. No change is done to web/index.html file if this flag is not provided. The value has to start and end with a slash "/". For more information: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base
    --static-assets-url                                      Used when serving the static assets from a different domain the application is hosted on. The value has to end with a slash "/". When this is set, it will replace all $FLUTTER_STATIC_ASSETS_URL in web/index.html for the given value.
    --pwa-strategy                                           The caching strategy to be used by the PWA service worker.

          [offline-first] (default)                          Attempt to cache the application shell eagerly and then lazily cache all subsequent assets as they are loaded. When making a network request for an asset, the offline cache will be preferred.
          [none]                                             Generate a service worker with no body. This is useful for local testing or in cases where the service worker caching functionality is not desirable

    --[no-]web-resources-cdn                                 Use Web static resources hosted on a CDN.
                                                             (defaults to on)

    --[no-]source-maps                                       Generate a sourcemap file. These can be used by browsers to view and debug the original source code of a compiled and minified Dart application.

    --dart2js-optimization                                   Sets the optimization level used for Dart compilation to JavaScript. Deprecated: Please use "-O=<level>" / "--optimization-level=<level>".
                                                             [O1, O2, O3, O4]

                                                             See https://flutter.dev/to/wasm for more information.
