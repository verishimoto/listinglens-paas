# The Opal Omni-Workflow
*"The Watcher leads the dance. The Detective finds the truth. The Developer builds the future."*

This unified workflow consolidates all agentic operations (Socratic Iteration, Injection, Watcher Control) into a single master routine.

## 1. The Watcher's Pulse (Control Room)
   **Role**: *Overseer*. Ensures hygiene, safety, and triggers the other agents.
   
   // turbo
   - [ ] **Sanitize**: Run `flutter clean` (optional, for hard resets) or verify `flutter analyze`.
   - [ ] **Repo Check**: Run `git status` to see the "Delta" (what changed?).
   - [ ] **Commit**: If changes exist, commit with type `feat(agent): [Description]`.
   - [ ] **Visualize**: Ensure the `main_dashboard.dart` (Control Room) is runnable for Stakeholder review.

## 2. The Prismatic Routine (Context Injection)
   **Role**: *Bridge*. Transfers state from Codebase (Antigravity) to Intelligence (NotebookLM).
   
   - [ ] **Cove Analysis**: Update `notebooklm_context_injection.md`.
     - *Content*: State "Where we are at", Current Critical Code, and User's Strategic Intent.
     - *Goal*: Frame the prototype as a "Fixer-Upper" needing strategic media advice.
   - [ ] **Injection**: 
     - 1. User copies `notebooklm_context_injection.md`.
     - 2. User pastes into NotebookLM.
     - 3. User runs prompts from the "Socratic Database" (or the "250 Prompts" CSV).

## 3. The Detective's Loop (Socratic Iteration)
   **Role**: *Strategist*. NotebookLM analyzes the injection and reports back.
   
   - [ ] **Media Strategy**: NotebookLM creates the "Media Plan" (Audio, Mindmap, Report) based on the "Fixer-Upper" state.
   - [ ] **Missing Points Report**: NotebookLM identifies what Antigravity missed physically or logically.
   - [ ] **Feedback**: User pastes NotebookLM's output back to Antigravity.

## 4. The Developer's Execution (Antigravity)
   **Role**: *Builder*. Implements the mandate from the Detective.
   
   - [ ] **Refinement**: Update code based on the "Missing Points".
   - [ ] **Polish**: Apply "Liquid Glass" and "Apple-style" aesthetics as requested.
   - [ ] **Loop**: Return to Step 1 (Watcher) to commit and re-inject.
