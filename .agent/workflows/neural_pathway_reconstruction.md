# Neural Pathway Reconstruction

// turbo

This workflow implements the "Socratic Iteration" logic, chaining specific cognitive prompts to reconstruct the AI's reasoning process before implementation. It merges `[/foreseeable_future_regret_decrease]` with the `Whisperer Deck` knowledge base.

## Phase 1: The Mindset (Epistemic Foundation)

*Goal: Map the territory and prune inefficiencies.*

1. **Map Uncertainty (Prompt 20)**: "Create three maps: Known knowns, Known unknowns, Unknown unknowns."
2. **Shift Paradigm (Prompt 22)**: "View the problem through: Mechanistic, Organic, Quantum, and Informational lenses."
3. **Decompose System (Prompt 32)**: "Break [SYSTEM] into subsystems. Identify feedback loops."
4. **Recursive Questioning (Prompt 40)**: "Why this question? What assumptions underlie it?"
5. **Reframe Patterns (Prompt 42)**: "Reframe negative constraints into creative opportunities (CBT)."
6. **Eliminate Redundancy (Prompt 169)**: "Identify and remove structural redundancies that do not add resilience."

## Phase 2: Application Pattern (Cognitive Execution)

*Goal: Execute with balanced cognitive resources.*

1. **Distribute Load (Prompt 47)**: "Allocate: 25% Analytical, 25% Creative, 25% Critical, 25% Intuitive."
2. **Monitor Thinking (Prompt 54 & 60)**: "Metacognition check. Balance System 1 (Intuition) and System 2 (Analysis)."
3. **Inverse Definition (Prompt 65)**: "Define what this solution is NOT."
4. **Fractal Search (Prompt 83)**: "Apply the pattern found at the micro-level to the macro-level."
5. **Calibrate Confidence (Prompt 90 & 93)**: "Rate confidence. Apply Planning Fallacy correction factor (1.5x time estimate)."
6. **Drill Root Cause (Prompt 173)**: "Five Whys deep. Address the root, not the symptom."

## Phase 3: Meta-Integration & Visual Flux

*Goal: Synthesis and Aesthetic Physicality.*

1. **Neural Mapping (Prompt 1)**: "Visualize the pathway: Input -> Pattern -> Weight -> Bias -> Synthesis -> Output."
2. **Synthesize Options (Prompt 101 & 121)**: "Satisfice (Good Enough) vs Optimize (Perfect). Combine partial solutions."
3. **Bayesian Update (Prompt 18)**: "Update prior beliefs with new evidence from Phase 1 & 2."
4. **Leverage & Holography (Prompt 207 & 227)**: "Find the high-leverage point. Ensure the whole is reflected in the part."
5. **Stakeholder Matrix (Prompt 237 & 241)**: "SWOT+TU Analysis (Trends/Uncertainties). Consider all stakeholders."
6. **Visual Flux Injection (Prompts 251-255)**:
    * **Liquid Physics**: "Treat UI as object in liquid."
    * **Photon Logic**: "Cursor is a light source."
    * **Hydration**: "Wake up on touch."
    * **Reactive Motion**: "No passive movement. Energy requires input."
