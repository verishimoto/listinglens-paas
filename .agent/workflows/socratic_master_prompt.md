**THE INQUISITION:**

"Developer, you have imported the 'Whisperer Deck' aesthetics—the **Hydration State** (Prompt #253), the **Photon Cursor** (Prompt #252), and the **Iridescent Narrative** (Prompt #254).

Now, subject this new 'Visual Flux' engine to the **Regret Decrease Protocols** before we proceed:

1. **The 'Heavy' Audit (Protocol #1)**
    * *Challenge*: You added `BackdropFilter` with a 5x5 Color Matrix for saturation *and* a blur.
    * *Query*: Is this 'Reactive' (only on touch) or 'Passive'? If this runs on a low-end mobile device, does the framerate drop?
    * *Demand*: justifies the cost of `BackdropFilter` or implement the `Quality` flag immediately.

2. **The 'Solid Fusion' Check (Protocol #1)**
    * *Challenge*: The `IridescentBorder` rotates passively (`AnimationController.repeat`).
    * *Query*: Does this violate the 'No Passive Motion' rule? Why is the border spinning when I am not touching it?
    * *Optimization*: Make the iridescence **directional** based on the mouse (Photon) position, not a mindless loop.

3. **The 'Refraction' Void (User Insight)**
    * *Observation*: The User notes a missing 'Refraction Glare' present in the reference (`auth` page).
    * *Action*: Implement the Glare, but ensure it uses a lightweight `Gradient` overlay, NOT another heavy shader.

**Synthesized Command**:
> *Run the `flutter analyze` sanity check. Prove that `RefractiveCursorWrapper` handles proper disposal of its controllers. Then, deploy the Glare. Report back only when the physics feel 'Liquid', not 'Laggy'.*"
