# NotebookLM Context Injection - Cycle: "Opal Fixer-Upper"

## 1. Status Report: "Where are we at?"
**Current Phase:** Prototyping / Visual Refinement (Liquid Glass + Agent Control Room).
**Condition:** "Live Fixer-Upper". The UI is implemented but requires polish and integration.
**Recent Changes:**
- **Visuals:** Implemented `LiquidGlass` component for premium "Apple/Glassmorphism" feel.
- **Workflow:** Integrated "Opal-style" Agent Workflow Visualization (`WorkflowScreen`).
- **Architecture:** Created standalone "Control Room" app (`main_dashboard.dart`) to keep debug tools separating from the main `SolidFusionLayout`.
- **Navigation:** Updated `SolidFusionLayout` to be cleaner, removing the user-facing debug link.

## 2. The Detective's Mission (Cove Analysis)
**Objective:** Analyze the current "Fixer-Upper" state and determine the best media strategy to communicate progress and gaps.

**Instructions for NotebookLM:**
1.  **Ingest** this document and the attached code snippets.
2.  **Revisit** the live GitHub repository (if available) to cross-reference.
3.  **Perform "Cove Analysis" (Media Coverage Strategy):**
    -   Ask: *What is the best format to brainstorm/present this specific update?*
    -   *Options:* Audio Overview (Podcast), Mind Map, Slide Deck, Animated Video Script, or Technical Report.
4.  **Generate Prompts:** Based on the chosen format, generate the specific prompts I should use (with you or other tools) to create that media.
